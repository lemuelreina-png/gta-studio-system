# Print & Wall Standards
## Wall Posters – Source of Truth

All wall posters displayed in the studio are **generated directly from the
GTA Studio System Git repository**.

They are visual enforcement tools, not independent rules.

### Active Posters
- Ops Wall Poster — Pi v1.0 (11x17)
  - Source: 02_OPERATIONS/DAILY_SHOP_OPEN_CLOSE_CHECKLIST.md
- Apprentice Wall Poster — Pi v1.0 (11x17)
  - Source: 03_APPRENTICESHIP system files

Rule:
System files are updated first.
Posters are regenerated from Git.
If it’s not in Git, it’s not enforceable.
Approved Print Sizes:
- 11x17 – Training & reminders
- 18x24 – Core Pi principles
- 24x36 – Anchor posters (Pi, Standards)
## QR Integration (Pi v1.1)

All wall posters include a QR code linking directly to their
source-of-truth file in Git.

Purpose:
- Immediate reference
- No verbal clarification
- Live system access

Rules:
- QR always points to GitHub source
- Posters do not link to PDFs or images
- If QR link breaks, poster is invalid

Poster QR Targets:
- Ops Wall Poster → 02_OPERATIONS/DAILY_SHOP_OPEN_CLOSE_CHECKLIST.md
- Apprentice Wall Poster → 03_APPRENTICESHIP system
Wall Logic:
- Eye level = principles
- Workstation level = process reminders
- Entry wall = culture & identity
Document wall poster source-of-truth and standards
Walls teach before people do.
