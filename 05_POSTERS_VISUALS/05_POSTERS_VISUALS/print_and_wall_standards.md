## QR Integration (Pi v1.1)

All wall posters include a QR code linking directly to their
Git-based source of truth.

Purpose:
- Live reference
- Zero verbal clarification
- Immediate system access

Rules:
- QR links point to GitHub source files only
- Posters never link to PDFs or images
- If the QR link breaks, the poster is invalid

QR Targets:
- Ops Wall Poster →
  02_OPERATIONS/DAILY_SHOP_OPEN_CLOSE_CHECKLIST.md
- Apprentice Wall Poster →
  03_APPRENTICESHIP system
## Version Stamping (Pi Standard)

All wall posters must include a visible version stamp.

Format:
Pi vX.X • Source: GitHub • Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

Rules:
- Version increases only when the source system changes
- Posters without a version stamp are invalid
- Outdated posters must be removed immediately
## Monthly Poster Audit (Pi Standard)

Frequency:
- Once per month

Audit Steps:
1. Verify poster version stamp matches Git
2. Scan QR and confirm correct source file opens
3. If mismatch exists, poster is removed or reprinted

Rule:
Outdated posters are removed, not debated.
