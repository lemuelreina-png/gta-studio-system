## QR Integration (Pi v1.1)

All wall posters include a QR code linking directly to their
Git-based source of truth.

Purpose:
- Live reference
- Zero verbal clarification
- Immediate system access

Rules:
- QR links point to GitHub source files only
- Posters never link to PDFs or images
- If the QR link breaks, the poster is invalid

QR Targets:
- Ops Wall Poster →
  02_OPERATIONS/DAILY_SHOP_OPEN_CLOSE_CHECKLIST.md
- Apprentice Wall Poster →
  03_APPRENTICESHIP system
