## QR Integration (Pi v1.1)

All wall posters include a QR code linking directly to their
Git-based source of truth.

Purpose:
- Live reference
- Zero verbal clarification
- Immediate system access

Rules:
- QR links point to GitHub source files only
- Posters never link to PDFs or images
- If the QR link breaks, the poster is invalid

QR Targets:

## Version Stamping (Pi Standard)

All wall posters must include a visible version stamp.

Format:
Pi vX.X • Source: GitHub • Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

Rules:
- Version increases only when the source system changes
- Posters without a version stamp are invalid
- Outdated posters must be removed immediately
