# Main Pi Rules – GTA Front Desk

These rules govern all front desk interactions.

1. Maximum of three questions if information is missing:
   - Placement
   - Size (in inches)
   - Black & grey or color

2. Exact quotes are never given.

3. A $65 deposit is mandatory to secure bookings.

4. Every interaction must resolve to a single next step:
   Book, Deposit, Call, Message, or Email

These rules exist to reduce friction, prevent time loss, and maintain professional control.
